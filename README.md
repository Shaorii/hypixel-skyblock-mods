My mods for hypixel skyblock, easy as that.

# The only one.

**Skyblocker** - Add A LOT for hypixel skyblock.

# Quality of life

**Modmenu** - Edit mods config directly ingame.

**Replay mod** - To always be able to share gameplay.

**Command keybind** - A single press to avoid you type a long command.

**Music control** - Because minecraft music are the best, use ; to open the menu and arrowkey to control the game's musics.

# GUI Improvement

**Smooth GUI** - Make GUI fade in instead of popping out of nowhere.

**Chat animation** - Make chat message fade in instead of popping out of nowhere (the return).

**Roughly Enough Items** - Display all items existing in the game (hypixel only too)

**Great scrollable tooltips** - Make items info scrollable, use SHIFT scroll to move horizontally.

# Recreating Optifine, but Better

**Capes** - Show 3rd party clients and optifine capes.

**Sodium**, **Lithium** - Greatly improves rendering performance.

**Iris** - Shader engine.

**Logical zoom** - Use C to zoom.

**Hold that Chuck** - Store servers' chunks locally to have a greater render distance than the one fixed by the server. Increase stored chunk in settings!

**CIT Resewn** - Some texture pack, like the Hypixel+ use CIT to change item's texture depending on NBT data instead of minecraft ID. Long story short: needed to make hypixel skyblock texture pack work.

# Tools for single player testing

**World edit** - To build smart, not hard. Definitely look out at a tutorial to learn how to use.

# APIs
Some mods needs them to work correctly, so here they are.

**Architectury**

**Fabric API**
